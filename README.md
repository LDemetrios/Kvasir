Kvasir (/kw…ë'zer/) is an (unofficial) Intellij IDEa plugin adding support for [Typst](https://typst.app/docs) language.

## Features

- Customizable syntax highlight
- Instant preview (Uses `typst watch` for now)
- Compilation errors display
- Theme-aware preview (background and foreground colors are accessible via `sys.inputs.kvasir-preview-background` and `-foreground` respectively, as a rgb hex string)

The plugin is in the beta stage, a lot of features are yet to come. 
See _Roadmap_ for the information about planned features, 
and _Nearest plans_ for those which are currently in development. 
Feel free to open issues and pull requests.

## Installation

The plugin can be manually installed from disk with [archive](distributions/Kvasir-0.2.0-signed.zip), 
or from JetBrains Marketplace by name.

## Known bugs

- Shorthands inside headings aren't highlighted properly.
- If `page.fill` is not `set` explicitly, the picture may appear transparent. `#set page(fill:white)` (or another color) helps.
- Errors in the `File Errors` are shown in the order of how they are located in the document, not in order of the stacktrace. I'm not sure if it's even possible, but I'm working on it.
